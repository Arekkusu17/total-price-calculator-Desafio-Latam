The meaning of this challenge is to validate JS knowledge my modifies to the DOM of the page.

Site of deploy: https://arekkusu17.github.io/total-price-calculator-Desafio-Latam/
## Work Done
- Write the html structure and the script.
It was easier to write first the script and moidify the DOM as needed. The styles were made later    

- Add Event Listeneres.
I used to Events, because each item has a different price based on their color. So the first event changes the unit price.
  
- Had some problems with the input type of the quantity. so i decided to go with `inputmode=numeric`.  
    
- Style the whole page, and did the mobile layout. The project is not that complex, so i preferred to do it at the end
- Add alt text for the item image
- As an Extra i was trying a function that helped me to return the total in the correct currency (with the dots), still working on it because i want to be able to apply it to the unit prices.
